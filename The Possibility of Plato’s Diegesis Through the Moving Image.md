**Abstract**

When we think of _diegesis_ and _diegetic_ in film studies, we know what the words refer to within the confines of the traditional scholarly definition of film in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. This understanding comes from a certain ontological common sense that narratologically film has a dual nature that consists of _mimesis_ and _diegesis_. Thinking about narration through images and sound, as opposed to the live-acted or read _drama_ or _epos_ in the times of Plato and Aristotle, has given birth to a synthetic view of the poet’s voice and the characters. In fiction films, _mimesis_ and _diegesis_ are so symbiotic that it is often difficult to distinguish between them. However, is it possible to think of films that are non-_mimetic_? In other words: is it possible for a film to be completely diegetic in the sense of Plato’s understanding of the word _diegesis_? Plato was against _mimetic_ arts because they were so far removed from the _eidos_ of what they were that there was no explicable use in presenting them. On the other hand, he very much approved or at least perhaps tolerated and recognized the importance of non-mimetic art forms such as music with specific modes of harmony or poetry that only contained the poet’s words where no characters were represented. With this view in mind, two steps will be taken in this paper: the first is questioning the possibility of a purely diegetic film, and the second is the significance of inquiring about such a work.

**Introduction**

The study of Plato in the fine arts, especially film studies, is doubtlessly notable; however, it is essential to turn back to the foundations to lose a step in the philosophy of film studies. Many concepts and terms come to us through the industry or academia; we take these for granted, forget the basics, and do not question what this would mean for both the production and the study of film as art. The aim of this paper is not to claim films as philosophical tools (Diehl, 2016) or to analyze a work of film from the perspective of Plato (Biderman & Weinman, 2019, p. 19), but to investigate Plato’s philosophy of art and his critique on the _mimetic_ nature of artworks. Whether it is possible to think of a film, even if the possibility is theoretical, that corresponds to his limitations and is outside the critique of _mimesis_, with help from Noël Carroll’s definition of the moving image, which is, if not perfect, the most complete of its kind; in other words, the aim is to try to find an answer to the question: is a Platonic \[a film that is harmonious with Plato’s understanding of _diegetic poetry_\] film possible? If possible, how would such a film be produced, and what would it consist of? It is vital that we first try to understand what Plato thinks of poetry in general, especially the difference between _diegetic_ and _mimetic_ poetry. The second step is to try to define the film and compare it with Plato’s diegesis and see if they are compatible. Finally, if compatibility is found, then the question that shall be asked is, what is the importance of such an inquiry? Before beginning the inquiry, it must be noted that such a task will lead us to question the nature of an artwork, namely a film, and open new discussions to the study of the nature of artworks; consequently, we shall also question whether the naming of a concept or, in this case, an artwork is valuable.

**Plato’s Theory of Ideas, Mimesis and Diegesis**

Plato is one of the earliest philosophers who explicitly wrote and discussed art that we know of. He is also one of the earliest philosophers to criticize the value of art in line with his theory of Ideas. To grasp why Plato criticizes the value of art and why the common belief is that he _bans_ artists and their artworks from his ideal city, we must first lay out his theory of ideas about _images_ and _poetry_. Though Plato has never claimed that any of the written theories and concepts are his own in the works themselves, neither did the main character in his dialogues Socrates, it can be assumed that the doctrine of Socrates and Plato comes from an oral tradition (Karamanolis, 2021) of philosophy that can be traced back to the pre-Socratics, especially Pythagoras and the Heraclitus \[“μετὰ δὲ τὰς εἰρημένας φιλοσοφίας ἡ Πλάτωνος ἐπεγένετο πραγματεία, τὰ μὲν πολλὰ τούτοις ἀκολουθοῦσα, τὰ δὲ καὶ ἴδια παρὰ τὴν τῶν Ἰταλικῶν ἔχουσα φιλοσοφίαν. ἐκ νέου τε γὰρ συνήθης γενόμενος πρῶτον Κρατύλῳ καὶ ταῖς Ἡρακλειτείοις δόξαις, ὡς ἁπάντων τῶν αἰσθητῶν ἀεὶ ῥεόντων καὶ ἐπιστήμης περὶ αὐτῶν οὐκ οὔσης…” (Aristotle, Aristotle's Metaphysics, 987a29 1924)\] (Aristotle, 1989, 987a), and the Ancient Greek literature that consists of Hesiod and Homer.

However, this debate is not a concern because we shall focus on what is said within the works, and whatever within the results is more valuable than how they came to be, certainly in this case. Plato’s works that can be cited that contain thoughts and criticism on beauty, _mimesis_ \[μίμησις\], and art, in general, can be listed as _Ion_, _Sophist_, _Phaedrus_, _Hippias Major_, _Laws_, and the infamous _Republic_. Only one of these dialogues has art, artist, and art performance or interpretation as their primary concern, which is _Ion_. In _Ion_, Socrates and Ion discuss whether the poet and the rhapsode may ever capture the knowledge of the characters in their poem or if the practice is merely a type of imitation that has no value; this is a direct criticism of _mimesis_ which we will come back to later on. The dialogue of _Phaedrus_ bears discussions on the soul, divine inspiration, and art (Plato, 1997, p. 506). The _Sophist_ compares _sophism_ to _mimetic art_ (216a-236d), _Hippias Major_ discusses the concept of beauty \[kalos\] in artworks (290a-b, 297e-298a)_, Laws_ talks about _mimesis_ and poetry (Plato, 1997, p. 1318). Finally, the third and tenth books of the _Republic_ contain critiques, limitations, and comparisons of _mimetic_ and _diegetic_ art and why _mimetic_ art and some _diegetic_ art would never be accepted in the ideal city (Plato, 1997, p. 971). Before discussing and trying to understand, _mimesis,_ one must first have a good grasp of what Plato means by _idea_ \[eidos (εἶδος) in Greek or sometimes referred to as Form in English\].

Let us begin with Plato’s _Theory of Ideas_ and move on to the definition and dangers of poetry through _mimesis_ afterward. The Greek word _eidos_ means idea, form, image, shape, appearance, sight, or kind (Liddell, et al. & McKenzie, 1940). Most of Plato’s dialogues discuss a kind of _whatness,_ i.e., _what is beauty?_ in The _Hippias Major_, so the idea of a thing could be thought of as the whatness of the definition that can only refer to the specific idea itself. For example, in the _Laches_, after different types of courage have been given as examples, Socrates asks, “what is it that, being in all these things, is the same?” which means that courage may _appear_ to be in many ways that can be distinguished there _is_ something that is the same that binds them together (Ross, 1963, p. 11). In the _Republic,_ Socrates defines an idea as: “And beauty itself and good itself and all the things that we thereby set down as many, reversing ourselves, we set down according to a single form of each, believing that there is but one, and call it ‘the being’ of each” (Plato, 1997, 507b, p. 1128). The aim of such a search for knowledge is that Plato, through Socrates, believes that one must have the “knowledge of what virtue is” to truly be virtuous (Ross, 1963, p. 12). The search for knowledge is what drives Socrates, and therefore Plato and this love for the search for knowledge comes from the tradition that is written on the wall of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi: “Know thyself” \[“γνῶθι σαυτὸν”\] (Plato, 1997, 48c, p. 398). This maxim is the ultimate philosophical endeavor of Socrates and Plato that comes from an earlier tradition as mentioned before \[another example is Aeschylus, who also refers to “know thyself” in _Prometheus Bound_ (Griffith, 1983)\]. So everything that is written in the dialogues in some way or another relate to the journey for the search of the self and the _idea_ of self “is the most important thing to learn about and that it’s by their relation to it that just things and the others become useful and beneficial” (Plato, 1997, 505a, p. 1125).

With that in mind, it is essential to learn the _Good_ itself first and then later try to grasp the _good_ of something else, all of which is to gain self-knowledge, which would bring us closer to the _Good_ itself as divine. So then, Plato’s argument spoken through Socrates begins with the claim above that without the knowledge of good, the ability of anything else is useless (Plato, 1997, 505a, p. 1125), this means that even if we reach the knowledge of something we would not benefit from it in any way possible (Santas, 1977, p. 2). Though a definition of the Good is undoubtedly mysterious and baffling (Santas, 1977, p. 3), Socrates concludes that the Good is not “knowledge or pleasure” (505bcd). Except the Good every idea is an attribute of the idea of Good, this means that every thought is the “best of its kind,” and everything that appears to us is _a kind_ of the idea itself that is the “best of its kind” (Santas, 1977, p. 8). Therefore Plato believes that the only perfect is the Good itself and everything that is a copy and everything that is only an imperfect copy of an attribute of Good, of which all ideas come from, is less perfect, therefore not as valuable as the idea itself of whatever that thing may be. For example, a circle that is drawn on a piece of paper is only a copy of the perfect idea of a circle which itself is an _idea_ because it must be connected to the concept of the Good to be a perfect circle that can only exist as an _idea_ and not as a physical copy. Everything that appears to us, all the _phenomena_, are imperfect copies of _ideas_ that only God can reach. This is the main reason for the argument of Plato against the imperfectness of artworks and the inability and incapability of artists.

Furthermore, the criticism is also based on the definition and the acquirement of knowledge \[ἐπιστήμη: knowledge, acquaintance with a matter, understanding (Liddell, Scott, Jones, & McKenzie, 1940)\] compared to _art_ or _skill_ \[τέχνη: art, skill, craft, an art (Liddell, Scott, Jones, & McKenzie, 1940)\]. While _tekhne_ means a certain knowledge of a skill that might be useful in a craft, i.e., a carpenter has the _tekhne_ of carpentry, _episteme_ refers to philosophical knowledge or to know something “as it is” (Plato, 1997, 477b, p. 1104). Then, on the one hand, we have _tekhne,_ which is the knowledge of a skill in the practical sense, and on the other hand, _episteme_ is the knowledge of the idea of a thing. In the _Republic_, Plato criticizes poetry as well as painting, sculpture, and music, through their use of _mimesis_ \[imitation or simulation (Liddell, Scott, Jones, & McKenzie, 1940)\] based styles and rejects to accept any artist and any kind of artwork that use such a style of _poiesis_ \[ποίησις: a fabrication, creation, production, poetic composition (Liddell, Scott, Jones, & McKenzie, 1940), also means to bring forth, create, give birth in the _Symposium_\], especially those works that imitate the _evil_ and the _unvirtuous_. This is because Plato, and Socrates for that matter, is not convinced that an artist could have the same _tekhne_ and _episteme_ of the character that is imitated in a poem. In the _Ion_, another plane is reached as Socrates talks about the rhapsode \[someone who recites, interprets, and claims to have _tekhne_ of poetry\] and the impossibility of the rhapsode to reach the _tekhne_ and _episteme_ of Homer, for example, let alone Homer being capable of having the _tekhne_ and _episteme_ of Achilles in the _Iliad_ (Plato, 1997, Ion, 537d-e-538a, pp. 944-945)_._

Then, if the artist only has the _tekhne_ to create the artwork itself and not the _tekhne_ of what a character or an object is depicted in the work, Plato concludes that the artist is nothing but an _imitator_. Imitative or _mimetic_ art then may be defined as portraying some kind of living or nonliving being as it appears in the world, which means that the portrayed object is itself a copy of an idea that is in itself perfect, making the object of art the third degree of copying, a copy of a copy (Plato, 1997, 603ab, p. 1207). The copy of the _idea_ itself is already less valuable than the _idea_; therefore, the copy of a copy is the least valuable of the three, which also means that it has no use or benefit. This is true for almost all the Ancient Greek works of art that either imitate an object or a person, such as in a painting or imitate a person or a God in poetry. Suppose we remember that tekhne not only refers to the artwork but also to a craft or knowledge of a certain practical skill. In that case, it is easier to see why it is important for Plato to consider the danger of the artwork imitating people and objects. Plato’s main concern here is the person’s imitation and what the person says and does, written by the poet. Plato’s concern is with knowledge and the depiction of knowledge. It does not seem possible for the artist to have true knowledge of ideas as a philosopher or the _tekhne_ of carpentry as a carpenter. For Plato, a _mimetic_ artwork in no way represents a person as true as in nature. Thus, it must be considered damaging to the youth or the people that do not possess the ability to differentiate between the copy and the real thing (Plato, 1997, 608a, p. 1212). For example, when depicting gods, Homeros writes that he knows the _tekhne_ better than the masters and puts gods in “un-Godlike” situations. According to Plato, one may only be a master of one thing and not many things; if the person is involved in many things, we may not call that person a master of anything (Plato, 1997, 397e, p. 1035). For instance, someone who is a master charioteer has the _tekhne_ of charioteering. However, Homer is nothing but an imitator who talks about the charioteer and makes the charioteer speak. Without a doubt, Plato does not believe that Homer could know charioteering better than a charioteer and only imitates it (Plato, 1997, Ion, 537bcd, pp. 943-4). It is the same with a painter imitating the idea of a table by painting a table that a carpenter has made, which comes from the mind of God as an idea itself. The table in the painting is a kind of table, but it is an imitation of a copy of a table. Since the painter cannot know the craft of making a table and a carpenter, the painter is nothing but an imitator (Plato, 1997, 597d, p. 1202). However, this is not where Plato ends this thought with; he gives a possibility of an artwork that is not _mimesis_ if it is done with _diegesis_, or narration, which is based on the knowledge of the poet alone and not someone else; the _diegetic_ artwork, then, is certainly more valuable than the _mimetic_ artwork (Plato, 1997, 393d, p. 1031). In other words, an artwork that is based on imitating but more importantly this imitation is only valueless when the _imitated_ is either “gods, heroes, daemons, and things in Hades” (Plato, 1997, 392a, p. 1030), which is a line by Socrates that is perhaps overlooked when discussing Plato’s distrust for art and artists. Plato’s concern is surely not all art and artists but a _certain_ kind of practice of art that tries to imitate what is in part divine and beyond the human capability of understanding. After this remark, Socrates says what is left to discuss is only the stories about “human beings” (Plato, 1997, 392a, p. 1030). However, there is another problem here to keep in mind that Socrates reminds us which is that poets are mostly preoccupied with the _bad_ things that concern human beings, and this is not something that they could allow and must “order the poets to compose the opposite kind of poetry and tell the opposite kind of tales” (Plato, 1997, 392b, p. 1030), which is again only possible once they have established what _justice_ is to evaluate such artworks as being worthy of acceptance in the ideal city. Socrates categorizes all narratives, which is divided into narratives about past, present, or future, divided into three styles: narrative alone, narrative through imitation, or both (Plato, 1997, 392d, p. 1030). According to Plato, then, if the poet only narrates with words that belong to them and does not try to imitate the speech of a divine being, hero, or spirit, we can consider this poem to be a narrative without imitation (Plato, 1997, 393d, p. 1031). So far, the _what_ and the _how_ are established: the poet should only narrate virtuously without imitation. However, at this point, we realize through two remarks that Socrates makes that he is not _condemning_ any type of poetry because it is not valuable in itself. Still, it is not valuable to the _citizens_ of the city specifically, the first and second of which are the following: “Then, if we’re to preserve our first argument, that our guardians must be kept away from all other crafts to be the craftsmen of the city’s freedom, and be exclusively that, and do nothing at all except what contributes to it…” (Plato, 1997, 395bc, p. 1033) and “…if a man, who through clever training can become anything and imitate anything, should arrive in our city, wanting to perform his poems, we should bow down before him as someone holy, wonderful, and pleasing, but we should tell him that there is no one like him in our city and that it isn’t lawful for there to be” (Plato, 1997, 397e-398ab, p. 1035). Thus, it should not be forgotten that Plato’s laws for the ideal city aim to bring harmony even if that means letting go of certain pleasures that may be deemed valuable; it should not be understood as if Plato is completely _against_ the concept of art, artist, and artwork. Correspondingly, this paper aims to explore if we would be able to achieve the style of artwork that Socrates describes as virtuous and without imitation.

With the hope of having determined the _what_ and the _how_ of poetry and _mimesis_ that we should be wary of, we have yet to define what Plato meant by narration without imitation and what that would entail; what, then, is _diegesis_ without _mimesis_? The _imitator_ is the one who imitates the copy of the idea only in its appearance to the _imitator_ (Plato, 1997, 601b, p. 1205). The craftsman crafts the object as a copy of the idea that comes from God \[or what Plato means here is the craftsman God which is _demiourgos_ (δημιουργός)\], and we can perceive this object as it appears from all points of view in the world. However, the imitator only imitates what seems at a certain angle, distance, space, et cetera, making the image far more removed than the truth. However, this point is only relevant when talking about painters or sculptures and not so about poets. If poets narrate what appears to them, they are not imitating but only talking about what they have perceived themselves and not about someone who has created \[poiesis\]. Thus the narration itself is a sort of creating \[poiesis\] a different creation than that of God’s, which is also why Plato allows such a form of poetry insofar as the narration is about something virtuous and just, something _good_. We can determine a pure narration in the poetic language. However, we are still struggling to escape Plato’s limitations when it comes to the _image_ because an image is always an _image of something,_ meaning that it is always a sort of imitation. Is it possible for an image to be a narration that belongs to the artist, then? In Socrates’ speech in the tenth book of the _Republic,_ it is apparent that there is a door left ajar for pleasurable mimetic poetry only if the proponents of such an artform can defend its pleasantness and benefit (Plato, 1997, 607, p. 1211-12).

In conclusion, a purely _diegetic_ poem that shows justice and virtue, in other words, anything that comes from the idea of good, is certainly allowed and revered in the ideal city of Plato’s _Republic_, the problem is with _mimetic_ poetry or artworks that are aimed to please and consist of things that are bad in the human nature or depiction of divine things and beings as having mortal qualities. If we get back to the most crucial question to us in this paper, whether a _diegetic image_ is possible or is it oxymoronic? There is certainly a reason that Socrates talks about paintings in addition to mimetic poetry when emphasizing the dangers and uselessness of imitation, and uses the word _εἴδωλον_ \[_eidolon_, meaning phantom, image, likeness, idea, coming from the word _eidos_\], claiming that the imitator knows nothing of the being \[_ὄντος_\] but only the appearance \[_φαινόμενο_\] of things as they are (Plato, 1997, 601b, p. 1205). The word _eidolon_ is often translated as _image itself_, which comes from the Latin _imago_, which leads us to think of the image. What is an image? Insofar as Plato handles the concept of the image, it comes to mean nothing but an appearance of a thing in another space than where that thing existed initially, the thing itself already being an image of the _idea_ from the _idea_ of Good, which is from God. Thus, an item in nature is already an image of its _idea_, then the image of that thing means that it is an _image_ of an image, as mentioned before: a copy of a copy. This vicious cycle was avoided when the poet narrates the appearance in their own words in a poem, so how can a painter or an image-maker set themselves free from the bondage of imitation if the word image itself would mean imitation or likeness? This seems only possible if the poet creates something that is not created by someone else or God, so the same thing would be possible for the image-maker: if the image is only a copy of the idea onefold, and not twofold as a copy of a copy, or the narration of the said idea. Could an image show or narrate an idea?

We would immediately think of abstract images that could be considered free of the bondage of imitation, but what about the benefits that Plato emphasizes? Do abstract images serve a purpose, or would they be able to convey virtuousness, justice, or the good itself? This way of thinking feels forced as it could go anywhere until the postmodernists, which is entirely outside the scope of the inquiry of this paper. If we eliminate the abstract images, then what are we left with? The images themselves could represent something other than what they imitate, which seems to be a way of going around the issue of copying a copy for pleasure or copying. If the image represents something other than what the image consists of, this would mean that the image could be a hieroglyphic language. On the other hand, the language argument for images and art is nothing new: for example, Ferdinand de Saussure, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Louis Althusser, the Formalists. Without reaching far, we must keep within the scope of Plato and not get ahead of the argument to try to show a point. Seeing as Plato never claimed that images could be used representationally in the form of a language, it would be dangerous to suggest so without any basis. If we come back to the regulations of purely narrative poetry that are laid out in the _Republic_ and think of what is expected of the artist, perhaps we would be able to reach a point about an image-based art form that Plato could accept: the poem must show something related to the _idea_ of Good, virtuousness and justice, must be spoken by words of the poet, and must not imitate any other person or God. Indeed, whenever a painter paints something, it would either be useless or imitate nature, a person, or something God has created. This is as far as we can come through the _Republic_ and _Ion_ regarding imitation and the problem of knowledge about artworks; the only sure thing we can take out of it is that purely narrative poetry is _acceptable_. On the other hand, the somewhat contradictory remarks when considered at first but perhaps shed some light on how Plato understands imitation. The dialogue itself is aimed to talk about _sophists_ as _imitators_ or rather artists who try to _deceive_; however, we get a clearer idea of the styles of imitation, which may be acceptable when compared to the way sophists and some lowly artists use imitation (Plato, 1997, p. 256). There are two types of imitation which are likeness-making and appearance-making; At the same time, both of them are not worthy; the appearance-making style of artists and sophists is the most worthless of the two as it goes beyond reality and tries to sell a type of reality that is an illusion, which is a very unvirtuous practice for Plato (Plato, 1997, p. 257). In this sense, appearance-making is image-making that represents a specific appearance only, just like the painter painting a table from a certain perspective that makes it look the painter intends. Still, the table itself is never seen from one perspective. Plato considers sculptures that resemble the original are more acceptable than paintings and _sophistic_ arguments that deal with appearance-making. Furthermore, thinking of images that represent something other than what they depict as if they are sort of a language seems too close to what Plato talks about when he says _appearance-making_ because the images _appear_ to be something other than what they hold. Yet, what if we consider photography rather than painting and compare this to likeness-making? Let us now then inquire into what a photographic and a moving image means and see if there is any way that we can provide a sufficient response to Plato in regards to image-making that is not necessarily imitation, however oxymoronic that may sound.

**Definition of the Moving Image**

To define the moving image, we must first define what a photographic image is, having discussed the meanings of the word image itself. The word photography comes from two Greek words meaning _light,_ and _I write_ φωτός \[photos\] and γράφω \[grapho\]. Photography, then, means writing with light, since the celluloid film is burned with light that reflects on it through the lens, the lens is a sort of control mechanism that can be used to determine how much and how long the light that shines from the objects that the camera is directed at will pass and in what way, which is also the reason why realists argue that photography and hence cinematography are more realistic than painting, which we will certainly come back to later on. Correspondingly, photography, indeed, is something entirely different than painting and sculpture or any other visual art form when it comes to imitation, as André Bazin discusses extensively in his well-known article _The Ontology of the Photographic Image_ (Bazin & Gray, The Ontology of the Photographic Image, 1960). Without much detail about how photography is different from painting and sculpture, we can assume that a narrative is quite limited. Arguing that photography can be a type of poetry seems far-fetched compared to the moving image or _film_. If we suppose that our aim is to tell a story, time is of the essence; the poet begins, develops, and ends their narrative in time. Even if it is read, there is a sense of flow. While, photography and painting are static, even if it is arguable that statues are capable of showing _movement_, this type of movement is quite different than the type of movement that we see in the moving image. Film seems much closer to poetry than photography, but we must first define the moving image to inquire further.

Subsequently, we are asking here _what film is?_ Or perhaps as André Bazin put it: “what is cinema? (Bazin, What is Cinema?, 1967). While having touched on the fact that film seems closer to poetry because of the sense of the flow of time and the depiction of movement, one must also ask oneself why film but not pure narrative poetry just as Plato has already accepted? Let us, then, try to answer the first question and clarify the use of different words such as film, moving image, and cinema. The word cinema comes from the French, a device called _le cinématograph_, an invention by Léon Bouly which the Lumières had bought the patent of, of which the skill _cinématographie_ itself is linked to both of which are made up of, again, two Greek words that mean _movement_ and _I write_: κίνημα \[kinema\] and γράφω \[grapho\] (Abel, 2004). Since the machine, _le cinématograph_, works by producing rapid photographs in sequence, it is related to photography because one _writes with the light on moving papers_. So, the word cinema comes from the machine itself and the use of the said machine, which is one of the crafts involved in filmmaking.

On the other hand, we have the word _film,_ which is often used for the singular work of art, which comes from the word for the paper coated with a photosensitive chemical (Photography, 2005). The name film, thus, refers instead to one of the media that could be used to create a cinematographic work of art that may also be called film, which means we have a word that points to two different things, which are two of the problems of keeping this term for specific works of art. This is why the term _moving image_ is used when referring to the art form that we have gotten used to knowing as a cinematic film.

In defining the _moving image,_ Noël Carrol suggests five necessary conditions for a work of art to be called a moving image and begins by rejecting medium-essentialism, which he believes to be the most popular and most problematic way of categorizing different forms of art (Carroll, 1996). Medium-essentialism, according to Carroll, is “the doctrine that each art form has its distinctive medium, a medium that distinguishes it from other forms (Carroll, 1996, p. 114).” This means that the medium of an artform is the defining characteristic of work, including the content and the style of said artwork. For example, if the medium for painting is considered a canvas painted by a brush, the artist is confined within the limits of the brush, the paint, and the canvas. Medium-essentialism also provides a way to evaluate artwork with the way the medium’s limitations are used, so if a work of art is successful, it is because it was made perfectly for the medium, or if it fails, then it was because of the limitations of the medium were not considered. However, Carroll thinks this way of theorizing and categorizing artforms is significantly flawed because of a few reasons: first of all is the fact that a painting, for example, could be painted with a brush, with a pallet, or with fingers, as well as the said painting, could be painted on different surfaces with different kinds of paints which points to multiple media being used for the same form of art. This argument is clearer in literature where a medium is difficult to define, especially if one were to say the word is the medium. Then, considering words or depiction of events, actions, and feelings as part of the medium would not distinguish literature from opera, theatre, songs, painting, and sculpture (Carroll, 1996, pp. 114-115).

Thus, medium-essentialism suggests that the medium of each artform is also the essence of the art form, which then limits the art form’s style and content. What then if we consider film? Carroll believes the medium of film is made up of light and shadows, but that makes it hard to distinguish from painting, photography, or magic lantern shows. Here, we see the concepts cinematography or film fail if they are used to refer to the art form. Defining the artform becomes more complex as new media are developed to be practiced; for example, we still refer to them as films, even with the coming of video, but they could also be made of magnetic tapes or digital data, which would mean that they share the same medium as musical tapes or types of digital art. Carroll also points out that this way of thinking comes with the idea that the essence of an artwork is based on its medium; it also suggests a telos of the form as if everything is dependent on the medium-essence. Nowadays, it is quite common to see moving images made without photography or even without cameras (so without cinematography) in a completely digital form, for example, 2D/3D rendered animations and abstract works (Carroll, 1996, pp. 114-116). Therefore, Carroll suggests that artforms are alterable, and the structure of media is determined by style and not the other way around as some medium-essentialist theorists would presume. That is why a definition of the moving image should not contain a specific medium.

So, the first necessary condition that Noël Carroll introduces is the ­_detached-display_. To understand why Carroll puts this as the first necessary condition, we should remember André Bazin and Bazinians that took his thoughts further to answer the question “what is cinema?” Bazin suggests photography as a basis for the art form. He believed that photography and film, unlike paintings, presented the image rather than representing it. While the painter intentionally means what they see or imagine, a photographer or a cinematographer can only see and record what is in front of the camera where the intention is limited by how the camera is positioned, the lens framed; everything else within the image except the actors could be unintentional, such as a bird or a plane passing by. In this sense, Bazinians believe that the photographic image presents a certain realism that cannot be disputed and is distinct from paintings. While the photographic image is automatic and produced by a machine, a painting is intentional and made by human hands. To counter this idea, Carroll gives an example of Picasso noticing an outline of a squirrel in the negative space of one of Braque’s paintings which he was unaware of when painting which suggests that sometimes even paintings could be unintentional or “automatic” in a way. The claim of photographic realists also fails when we consider films made with representational animated drawings or computer-generated effects or characters where the aspect of photography in film diminishes and sometimes disappears entirely or at least physically if not ideally (Carroll, 1996, p. 118). Consequently, to understand what Carroll means by _detached-display_ is that unlike aids of vision like telescopes, binoculars, or microscopes, the moving image is viewed in a place different than where my body would be if I were to be looking towards the same view of the camera through binoculars or a telescope or the visor that is on the camera at the time of the shoot. This makes the display in front of us on the screen detached from where it was recorded, which isn’t the case with aids of vision. This is a necessary condition for all photographic and cinematic images. Of course, this condition does not help us distinguish the moving image from paintings because paintings can also be detached-displays. For this, Carroll introduces a second condition: the _movement_ of the images. He quickly counters his suggestion with films that have no activity within the images themselves, such as films made of photographs like _La Jetee; still_, he suggests that a work of film always has the potentiality of movement even if this potential is not actualized. On the other hand, paintings do not have the potentiality of movement because if they do, they are not paintings but another form of art. We could add that the images themselves are always moving even if every frame has the same image as before. The images themselves are moving either when projected in the photographic film format, or one could argue that the data are moving sequentially when launched in the digital format because every separate frame is shown one by one, thus having the potentiality of movement even if the illusion of movement is not portrayed within the images themselves. Therefore, the ability to show movement is another necessary condition for the moving image which distinguishes it from painting (Carroll, 1996, p. 125).

The third necessary condition for the moving image, which distinguishes it from theatre, is the performance token or the way the artwork is performed. Theatre fits with the first two conditions because the stage is not the _space_ of the spectator; it represents a different space than the one we are in and looking at, and theatre is also able to show movement if the work calls for it. As Carroll put it, what differentiates theatre from film is not performance but performance tokens. Both theatre actors and film actors perform, but one performs in front of the spectator in the theatre at that moment, and the other performs in front of the lens, which is then recorded and put together in a certain way. Carroll suggests that both performances can be tokens (an individual example). Still, the theatrical performance token is generated by interpretation, but the performance token in film is generated by templates. At the same time, theatre shows a performance that is considered an art work on its own, while a screening of a film is a performance that could not be an art form. This is another way of saying that films have multiple copies that could be shown at any time while theatre plays have two different types of tokens the play as a literary work and the play as an interpreted performance. The film consists of the interpretation and the recipe, the script, in one form while they could be viewed separately in the case of theatre. Thus, the moving image is different than theatre because the “(3) performance tokens of the moving image are generated by a template that is a token and (4) the performance tokens of the moving image are not artworks in their own right (because they are only screenings of the work)” (Carroll, 1996, p. 130).

Finally, as the fifth necessary condition of the moving image, Carroll suggests two-dimensionality to differentiate the moving image from the oddly specific dancing ballerina music boxes where the ballerina dances in a space that is not our own at the touch of a button which is not a performance that could be considered an art form (Carroll, 1996, pp. 130-131). All of which come together as: “the moving image is a detached display, that has the technical possibility of showing the impression of movement, the performance tokens of which are generated by a template that is a token, and the performance tokens of which are not artworks in their own right” (Carroll, 1996, p. 131).

In conclusion, Noël Carroll’s definition of the _moving image_ is a good contrasting example of what we have hoped for when discussing Plato’s definition of acceptable narrative poetry that avoids imitation. However, there are still a few issues that we can go around, such as what kind of performance tokens the moving image might consist of. If the moving image consists of performance tokens that are themselves imitations of characters through acting or narration , then we have not moved an inch from where we were before defining the moving image. Nevertheless, if we suppose that somehow we can consider the moving image-maker a poet and assume that the artist avoids imitation through acting and narration. In that case, there must be some way the artist can also purely narrate virtuously.

**Plato’s Moving Image**

Having discussed Plato’s theory of Ideas, view of poetry and art in general in regards to _mimesis_ and _diegesis_ as well as the definition of the _moving image_ by Noël Carroll, it is possible for us to, hopefully, compare the two to see if there is any correlation or a middle ground and consider what that might possibly mean to us in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

Plato’s ideal moving image, combined with Carroll’s definition, would be something like this if we leave it as is: the ideal moving image is a detached display that has the technical possibility of showing the impression of movement, the performance tokens of which are generated by a template that is a token, and the performance tokens of which are not artworks in their own right, that aims to virtuously narrate, without imitation, an _idea_, itself which comes from the _idea_ of Good, in relation to the goodness in the human nature. As we read this definition, we can see many flashing lights go against Plato, or things that, if we take out, Carroll might not consider a moving image. If we begin with the “impression of movement,” we see that it is a remark that screams the possibility of _appearance-making_ that Plato condemns in the _Sophist,_ which is something to consider. However, the impression of movement that Carroll has included here refers to how the moving images are captured and projected since the images show the subjects moving at an earlier time but not necessarily showing the movement in real-time. Hence, it is only an impression; on the other hand, this does not mean that the movement here is _deceiving_. If we were to stand beside the camera, we would not have been able to distinguish the movement if we were recording in, say, twenty-four frames and up. The other issue is the performance token, which Carroll needed to include to differentiate the moving image from theatre and literature; the performance of the moving image is not projecting it nor is the physical or digital copy of the film an artwork on its own. This performance could mean anything from actors to _things_ that move or are made to move or are intended to be shown by the moving image-maker. It seems impossible to think of anything outside of abstract images in experimental filmmaking that would be considered useless by Plato, which corresponds to a pure narrative through images because images themselves are thought to be copies of copies. There is only one way that we can get out of this, and, as mentioned before, which is using images as representing something other than what they contain, in a way, akin to language. However, it is not clear whether or not this would be appearance-making. If we assume the artist has good intentions of showing images in a way language would be used to narrate something and not imitate, then we have something as close to a Platonic film as possible. Good examples of such a film would be Stan Brakhage’s works _Cat’s Cradle_ (1959) and _Window Water Baby Moving_ (1959). We see the possibility of the moving image with _deceiving_ movement and a representation of persons and objects that are creations of someone other than the artist. What if we consider a moving image work with only color on the screen and voice-over narration, for example, _Blue_ (Jarman, 1993) by Derek Jarman? This is a work that contains the words of the artist Derek Jarman himself and only a certain shade of blue representing his failing eyesight before his death in the same year (Peake, 1999). The first argument against this work of moving image being in line with Plato’s regulations is the fact that the color does not move but is static, which still does not change the fact that the color that is projected on the screen is on each frame of the filmstock making it moving but staying more or less the same shade of blue, since, if the frames themselves move, then, it still is a moving image just as Carroll suggests, which is as mentioned before why he includes the “technical possibility of the impression of movement.” The second opposing argument to this work being in line with Plato’s views is the content of the narration, which is arguably not depicting the Good in human nature only but is rather grim since it is about what the artist is experiencing before his death. More works like these can be given as examples. Still, hopefully, these will suffice, for now, simply to show the possibility of such a film even theoretically or even perhaps interpreting the meaning of the image, though even Plato left some room to ponder in his writings, he even expected a poet to come and convince him as mentioned before.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, we have seen that Plato is not a philosopher who is entirely against the arts or artists as some could even argue that he is an artist when his works are considered and that he merely tries to find the ideal art form that would both be beneficial and be pleasurable to the extent that does not imitate bad things concerning God or human nature and virtuously tries to narrate the idea of Good or ideas that relate to the idea of Good. So, then, what does this mean for film studies and moving image in general? Why would it be necessary for Plato’s views to be inquired in terms of the moving image? It is important to come to terms with Plato’s criticism and consider his philosophy even in the 21<sup>st</sup> century not because his way of filmmaking would be superior to anything that is produced today but because this scrutiny would teach us to question the works that _are_ being produced, and if nothing it teaches us that without knowing what good is, we cannot evaluate a _good anything_. Without knowing what _good_ is, how can we say what a good film is? This is an important reminder to not overstep the bounds of our human minds as doing so only creates conflict and useless arguments that lead to nowhere but misery. Without knowing what a moving image is, how can one know what a good work of a moving image is even if one were to reach the knowledge of the idea of _good_ as a philosopher? The aim of this paper was merely to inquire into these questions to see where we can get to and certainly not to claim to have knowledge the idea of good as Plato suggests or to claim that this way of artmaking is superior. With such an inquiry, one is able to see the limits of both the artist and the philosopher, and hopefully, this leads to ethical responsibility.
